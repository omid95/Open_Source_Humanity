Breakdown of the polygen model
-Auto-regressive models
-Transformers
  -Feedforward networks
  
-Random points for initialisation of the model
-Predictions can be used as inputs in the next training iteration

-Learn starting from the bigger picture(Polygen model) then break it down to the smallest pieces. implement the small pieces with a bigger picture in mind
