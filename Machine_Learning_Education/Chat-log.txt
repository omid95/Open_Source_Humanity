I have always confused about the difference between classification and clustering.
ok, looks like clustering is used on unlabeled data
Classification is a technique where the models predict different categories according to the labels attached but in clustering there are no labels and the model has to learn to create it's own categories
ok, for a person like me who learns by example, we need to get more real work examples
I am going to focus on this diffrence
until I gain full confidence
I need to find some examples of algorithm for both
I am going to ask you questions
Okay Sir
k-mean is clustering?
K-means is an algorithm for clustering datasets according to specific points in the data
do you have a real-world example/algorithm for it?
The real world examples for k-means can include data from banks. Usually banks would want to predict and cluster customers according to there behaviour and know how to do marketing for the different clusters generated
Ok, let's find some implemented algorithm (code) and play with them
not just k-mean but any other clusteing methods
My times up for today(this part of my day)
thank you for chating

You this is a good method of learning : being curious and ask lots of questions
That is a big question for me: How to make students curious?
Please take a note --- we need to make student curious, so they keep asking questions----------
Okay, but am wondering how this can be achieved. Usually   to make people curious, you start with the applications of the algorithm and people get interest
One approach is to make them think (unconsciously). to make them engage don't start with ML, start with things that they know and love
for example if you want to teach a kid the concept of "height", you can start talking about their toys , then put their toys side by side and say this toy is higher than this one, because it goes higher to the sky!
